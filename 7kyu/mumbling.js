/**
 This time no story, no theory. The examples below show you how to write function accum:

Examples:
accum("abcd") -> "A-Bb-Ccc-Dddd"
accum("RqaEzty") -> "R-Qq-Aaa-Eeee-Zzzzz-Tttttt-Yyyyyyy"
accum("cwAt") -> "C-Ww-Aaa-Tttt"
The parameter of accum is a string which includes only letters from a..z and A..Z.
 */

//My solution
function accum(s) {
  //loop over the array
  //Create a new array and new elements to that new array based on the index of that element, i.e if the index is 1 repeat the element twice and if the index is 2 repeat the element three times
  //Make sure to capitalize the first addition to the new array
}
